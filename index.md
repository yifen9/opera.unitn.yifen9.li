## Hi

My name is Li. I live on the first floor of the block FA (aka FA1). My room number is 12.

I have a PC and a Nintendo Switch 2. To invite me to play:

- Steam: [AntoLee](https://steamcommunity.com/id/AntoLee)
- Nintendo: [SW-4303-7107-6429](https://lounge.nintendo.com/friendcode/4303-7107-6429/C6CWY5pYbQ)

More about me: [yifen9.li](https://yifen9.li)

## And by the way ...

I have a Canon TS7450i printer. I can provide you copying, printing and scanning, for free.

If you want, click the links below and fill in the template to send me an E-mail, and I will do the job for you:

- [Copy](mailto:mail@yifen9.li?subject=[Inquery]&20Print&20request&20-&20opera.unitn.yifen9.li&body=Hello)
- [Print]()
- [Scan]()

The only requirement is that, just don't do anything that will make my printer or my wallet explode you know.
